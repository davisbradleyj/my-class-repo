# Traverse That DOM

In this activity you are going to use the Chrome Dev Console and `.style.property` to change the styling of elements on our page.

## Instructions

* Create an `script.js`

* Using the provided `index.html`, complete the following

  * Target the div with the ID of `articles`.
    // document.getElementById("articles")

    * Change its font size to `50px`.
    // document.getElementById("articles").style.fontSize = "50px"
    
    * Change its first childs, last child to have a font color of `blue`.
    // document.getElementById("articles").firstChild.style.color = "blue"
    // document.getElementById("articles").lastChild.style.color = "blue" 
    
    * Change its previous sibling to have a background color of `black`.

  * Target the div with the ID of `main`.

    * Change its second child node so the text is `underlined`.

    * Change its last child element to have a font size of `50px`.

    * Change its first child element to have a font color of `orange`.
    
    * Change its last child elements parent to have a font size of `40px`.

## Bonus

* Change 3 other elements styles that we did not ask for above.
