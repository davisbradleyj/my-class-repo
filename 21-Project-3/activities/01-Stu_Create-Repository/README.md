git push origin master


### Step Eight

Invite collaborators: 

* From the repo's main page, click the "Settings" tab.

* Once in the repo's settings, select the "Collaborators" menu item on the left.

* From the "Collaborators" page invite your group members to be project collaborators by entering their Github usernames one at a time.
