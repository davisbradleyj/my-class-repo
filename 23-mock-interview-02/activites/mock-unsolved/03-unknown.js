// given a word, if scrambled, can it become a palindrome
// does string have repeated characters, ie existing more than once
// how many repeating characters
// does the word have less than 2 unique charactr
// penne = nepen, enpne
// arr.length % 2 = 0 ~ even number of characters
// // function to determine all characters repeat an even number of times
// arr.length ~ odd
// // only one character exists a unique number of times, all other characters repeat an even number of times
