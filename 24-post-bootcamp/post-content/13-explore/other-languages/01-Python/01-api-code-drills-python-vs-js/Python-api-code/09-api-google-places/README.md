# Oh the Google Places we'll go...

In this exercise you'll get more practice using the Google Places API and requesting and manipulating data that is retrieved from the API.

## Let's practice...

* Reading API documentation
* Using geocode to find exact locations
* Creating parameters for an API request
* Converting the response to JSON and displaying it in a legibile format (pretty)
* Using `iterrows` to add keywords to the parameters
* Appending response data to an existing pandas dataframe

## API is Key

In order for you to test and make calls to the API you will need to generate your own API key and store it in a `config.py` file. An API key for this exercise can be generated at [this link](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)
