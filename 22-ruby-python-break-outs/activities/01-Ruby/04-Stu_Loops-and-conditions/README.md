# Ruby

## Loops and Conditions

### Instructions
In this exercise, we'll be continuing with the store theme.

To complete this exercise, you'll need to learn some ruby syntax. Open up `examples.rb` to examine some code. Everything you need to complete this exercise will be found in that file.

To start, copy the dictionary you created in the last exercise, and paste it into prompt.rb

1. Loop through the items in your store, and print each item on a separate line.

2. Your store has had to cut down on production because of rising costs! Dynamically create an array of every other item from your inventory (So if my inventory was [1,2,3,4,5,6], I would create [2,4,6]).

3. No that we've listed all the items to be reomved, we're going to go ahead and remove them. Remove all the items in the array you created in the last exercise from your inventory.
