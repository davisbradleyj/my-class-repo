# Yelp API

In this exercise you'll be using the Yelp API to grab data and plot the data in a bar graph. This exercise is meant to give you more practice with calling an API as well as manipulating the data that you get back.

## This includes

* Calling the API to grab data
* Testing that API data is returned correctly
* Converting API responses into JSON format
* Storing the data as a pandas DataFrame
* Plotting the data in a bar graph

## Dependencies

In order for you to test and make calls to the API you will need to generate your own API key and store it in a `config.py` file. An API key for this exercise can be generated at [this link](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)

You must fill out the form to create an application. Your API key will be generated after filling out the form.
