## Summary
​
In this assignment, you'll use the Weather API to make a weather application. To finish this task, you must call the Weather API with axios. Build this application in React

### Before You Begin

1. **Hit the Weather API**.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
​
**General Layout**

1. Create a `Search-Form` component that takes user input

2. Onclick of search button should call both `History` and `DisplayWeatherForecast` component passing it's respective props

3. When the component mounts, you have to make a call to the *weather-api* and depending upon the search results, map out the `DisplayWeatherForecast` component
