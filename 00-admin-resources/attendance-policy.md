## Attendance
[Back to Course Guidelines](../../README.md#course-guidelines)

You can miss **no more** than a total of **3 classes**.


A total of **2 classes** may be taken remotely with *prior approval*.

Expectations for remote class:

* Consistent interaction with TAs on Slack throughout the durations of class time.

* Possible collaboration with other students if they, too, are attending remote.

* Completion of all classroom activities prior to class end.

This program is designed to be an in-person, collaborative learning experience and the expectation remains for students to be in class for all sessions. 

Remote session attendance (2 max) is being provided as an exception for students with *extreme circumstances*, where in-person attendance is not an option, but students wish to stay on track as much as possible. This allowance is not meant to replace being in the classroom.

Remote attendance during project not permitted as students are required to complete 100% of project work and project participation is required to meet graduation criteria.

Students must request in advance to be remote and be approved. Staff should review if students meet remote eligibility.
