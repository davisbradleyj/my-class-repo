# Eventbrite API

In this exercise you'll be using the Eventbrite API to grab data. This exercise is meant to give you more practice with calling an API as well as manipulating the data that you get back.

## This includes

* Calling the API to grab data
* Testing that API data is returned correctly
* Converting API responses into JSON format
* Storing the data in lists
* Storing the data in objects
* Setting the data into a pandas dataframe

## Dependencies

In order for you to test and make calls to the API you will need to generate your own API key and store it in a `config.py` file. An API key for this exercise can be generated at [this link](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/api_overview/authentication/#ebapi-getting-a-token)
