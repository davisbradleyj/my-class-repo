# Firebase Assignment - Rock Paper Scissors


### Overview

In this assignment, you'll indeed create another Rock Paper Scissors game. The catch? You're going to make this an online multiplayer game, all with the help of Firebase (and the rest of your web development repertoire)!

### Setup

1. Create a GitHub repo called `RPS-Multiplayer` and clone it to your computer.

2. Create a file inside of your `RPS-Multiplayer` folder called `index.html`. This is where your page's HTML will go.
3. Don't forget to include [jQuery](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js) and [Firebase](https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/live/3.0/firebase.js).

4. Inside `RPS-Multiplayer`, create your `assets` directory.
5. Create the folders and files you typically place in `assets` -- just like you had for the prior weeks' homework assignments.

### Instructions

* Create a game that suits this user story:

  * Only two users can play at the same time.

  * Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

  * The game will track each player's wins and losses.

  * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

  * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

  * Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.

  **Good Luck!**
