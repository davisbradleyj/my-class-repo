# Image Compression

In this activity you are going to use an online compression tool to decrease image file sizes for the Gallery App.

## Instructions

* In this activity you will be using ImageOptim Online to compress images.

* First, unzip the `uncompressedImages.zip` file.

* Next, navigate to [ImageOptim Online](https://imageoptim.com/online)

* Select the following options:

  * Quality - Medium

  * Color Quality - Auto

  * Format - JPEG

* Now that our options are selected, click `Choose Files`.

* This will prompt you to select an image or images you would like to pass through the compressor.

* Go ahead and choose 3-5 images. Before accepting the choices, note the original file sizes so you can compare against the compressed image.

* Finally, click `Submit`.

* Once the compression is complete, a `zip` file will automatically download to your computer.

  * This will most likely be downloaded to your `Downloads` folder.
