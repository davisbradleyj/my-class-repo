// ================ PART 1 ================ //

// Create a variable called presTBody and select the element based on its ID in html.


// Console log the imported data from data.js



// Append each president to the table.
// HINT: 1 table row per president, with multiple table data elements in each row.







// ================ Challenge ================ //

// Create a variable called 'addBtn' and select the element with an id of 'add_btn'.



// Create an on click listener for the "add_btn" ID on your html.

  // Prevent the page from refreshing

  

  // Store the values of each id into separate variables.

  




  // Create an object called "input_data" as an object containing the keys of "number", "president", "birth_year", "death_year", "took_office", "left_office", "party"
  // Set their values corresponding to the variables you set earlier.

  





  // Create a table row and append each cell's value from input_data as table data.

  








// FINALLY If you haven't done so, add bootstrap CDN to your index.html and make it pretty.
