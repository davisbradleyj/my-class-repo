:fire: Greetings All! :fire:

Instructions: 

By optionally being part of the \_0-weekly-mock-interview channel you will be paired by the @shuffl bot once a week on Monday with one other student from class.

Once Paired:

1. Coordinate with your Pair a Day/Time to meet on Zoom. Dedicate Two Hours
2. Randomly find a single algorithm from the Post Bootcamp 13-explore/mock-interview-algorithms.
3. Study your questions well:

a. Clarify
b. Inputs/Outputs
c. Test & Edge Cases
d. Naive Solution
e. Reach an agreement
f. Code It Out
g. Analyze
h. Optimize

Be sure you are able to break-down each step of the problem into the following format:

Q : What are you going to do ?
Q : How are you going to do it ?
Q : Why are you going to do it ?
Q : What is the consequence / what is the expense?

4. Each pair will adhere to their agreed upon Zoom Meeting day/time.
5. You will then alternate being the interviewee and interviewer with your now mastered questions.

As an interviewee you should focus on:

• Clarity in your mental modeling of your approach
• Openness to feedback, hints, and suggestions
• Playfulness with the puzzle presented
• Engagement with your interviewer

~~~~~~~

As an interviewer you should focus on:
• Clearly articulating the prompt
• Seeking clarification not from what you understand the problem to be but how the interviewee is explaining it
• Providing suggestions and supportive guidance

~~~~~~~

Hold your interviewee to a high standard
Did they follow the pattern:

Q : What are you going to do ?
Q : How are you going to do it ?
Q : Why are you going to do it ?
