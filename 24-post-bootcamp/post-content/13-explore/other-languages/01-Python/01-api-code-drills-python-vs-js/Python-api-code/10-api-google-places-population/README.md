# Answering some old population questions with numbers...

In this exercise you'll be pulling from the census API, sifting through their data, and applying some mathematics to answer a few questions.
* Are there any correlations between the number of males or females on Unemployment Rate?
* What does the distribution of males and females look like by zipcode? Are there any oddities?
* Where are the majority of people based on census? Lets map it.

## Let's practice...

* Reading API documentation
* Describing data and some statistics.
* Creating parameters for an API request
* Cleaning/filtering data.
* Playing with maps.


## API is Key

In order for you to test and make calls to the API you will need to generate your own API key and store it in a `config.py` file. 
You can get your keys at the following:

google key: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key

census key: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
