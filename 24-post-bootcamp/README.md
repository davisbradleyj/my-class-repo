#### CONGRATULATIONS!!!

Welcome to the end of your course! You Made it!

Take a few days to get some rest, attend to some neglected relationships, and to fully embrace your new identity in the world as a **Full Stack Developer**!!!

Once you catch your breath dive back into our Post Bootcamp Track

<hr>

Welcome to your `Post Coding Bootcamp` Track.

This is your one-stop-shop for all things `Post Bootcamp` related.

Below your will find a `Track Listing` for `Course Content` listing.

***Suggested Usage***

- Work through the given modules in order (suggested)
- Open up a given module. 
- Explore *01-algos* within the module and try to solve those algorithms (Do It)

> If you have found yourself working through an algorithm with no progress after 30 minutes then explore the solution directory and make a note of your discovery. 

- Open *02-code-drills* inside the module and get your hands on keys and code the solution out


> If you have found yourself working through a code drill with no progress after 30 minutes then explore the solution directory and make a note of your discovery. 

- Finally, do a *Project Build*. Open *03-project-build* to see the project requirements

***Keep up a schedule*** Try to complete each module at the max within three days

How to spend your time:

*30% Course Content*

- Redo Classroom Activities from Week One Day One -> Week Twelve
- Complete ALL Code Drills from Week One  -> Week Twelve
- Refine any homework assignments
- Post Bootcamp Track

*30% Building New Projects or Expanding on Old Ones*
