## Summary
​
Create a BINGO Game application with Javascript

​
**Suggested Workflow**
​
- Create a function `newCard` that loops through an array of square cards to generate a newCard to play the game. If you want to generate 25 squares, then you might want to call the setSquare function 25 times to get 25 squares
- Create a function `setSquare` that populates the value in each square and updates the DOM in browser. 
- Grab the hold of each square so that you can get a hold of it with `id` using javascript.
- Create a function `getNewNumber` that generates a random number within 25 or something depending on your game logic
- HTML and CSS plays a major role in generating squares for your game. Have a specific `id` for each square so that you can keep track of them in your javascript logic
