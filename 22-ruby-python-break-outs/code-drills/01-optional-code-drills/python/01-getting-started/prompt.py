# YOUR WORK HERE

## Instructions
## - In prompt.py, ask the user for their: 
##  - first_name
##  - last_name
##  - middle_initial
##  - address
## - email
##  - phone_number 

## - Print a separator (a series of `=` for example). In Python you can multiply strings to print them as many times as you'd like.   
## - Once they've filled all the inputs, reprint their own information to them. For example:
##  - print('The student\'s first name is {0}'.format(first_name))
## - After the user has seen their information, ask them to confirm whether or not it is accurate (using another input).
