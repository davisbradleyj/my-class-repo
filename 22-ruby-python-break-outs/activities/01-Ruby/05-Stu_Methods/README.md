# Ruby

## Methods (functions) and imports

## Intro
Methods in ruby work and look a lot like functions in javascript. When we covered loops, we saw that ruby did not inlcude curly braces as a way to contain logic. The same is true for ruby's methods. 

In addition to covering methods, we will also discuss importing content from other files. 

## Instructions

1. In `helpers.rb`, create a method called `print_evens` that takes in an array of numbers and prints all the `even` numbers to the console.

2. In `helpers.rb`, create a method called `triple` that takes in an array of numbers. For each number in the array, it multiplies it by 3 and then prints the product to the console.

3. In `helpers.rb`, create a method called `state_name` that takes in a string of a state code (e.g. "CA" or "HI") and prints out the corresponding state to the console. For example. if the method takes in "CA" it will print out California. NOTE: you only need to account for 5 different states of your choosing; don't worry about all 50 states.
