## Homework Assignment

* 1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table `actor`.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM actor;
  ```

* 1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column `Actor Name`.

  ```sql
  SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)) AS `Actor Name`
  FROM actor;
  ```

* 2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name, actor_id
  FROM actor
  WHERE first_name = "Joe";
  ```

* 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name, actor_id
  FROM actor
  WHERE last_name LIKE '%GEN%';
  ```

* 2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters `LI`. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name, actor_id
  FROM actor
  WHERE last_name LIKE '%LI%'
  ORDER BY last_name, first_name;
  ```

* 2d. Using `IN`, display the `country_id` and `country` columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:

  ```sql
  SELECT country_id, country
  FROM country
  WHERE country IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');
  ```

* 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`, as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` are significant).

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE actor
  ADD COLUMN description blob AFTER last_name;
  ```

* 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the `description` column.

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE actor
  DROP COLUMN description;
  ```

* 4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.

  ```sql
  SELECT last_name, count(last_name) AS 'last_name_frequency'
  FROM actor
  GROUP BY last_name
  HAVING `last_name_frequency` >= 1;
  ```

* 4b. List last names of actors and the number of actors who have that last name, but only for names that are shared by at least two actors.

  ```sql
  SELECT last_name, count(last_name) AS 'last_name_frequency'
  FROM actor
  GROUP BY last_name
  Having `last_name_frequency` >= 2;
  ```

* 4c. The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`. Write a query to fix the record.

  ```sql
  UPDATE actor
  SET first_name = 'HARPO'
  WHERE first_name = 'GROUCHO'
  and last_name = 'WILLIAMS';
  ```

* 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.

  ```sql
  UPDATE actor
  SET first_name =
  CASE
   WHEN first_name = 'HARPO'
    THEN 'GROUCHO'
   ELSE 'MUCHO GROUCHO'
  END
  WHERE actor_id = 172;
  ```

* 5a. You cannot locate the schema of the `address` table. Which query would you use to re-create it?

  ```sql
  SHOW CREATE TABLE address;
  ```

* 6a. Use `JOIN` to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables `staff` and `address`:

  ```sql
  SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, a.address
  FROM staff s
  INNER JOIN address a
  ON (s.address_id = a.address_id);
  ```

* 6b. Use `JOIN` to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables `staff` and `payment`.

  ```sql
  SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, SUM(p.amount)
  FROM staff AS s
  INNER JOIN payment AS p
  ON p.staff_id = s.staff_id
  WHERE MONTH(p.payment_date) = 08 AND YEAR(p.payment_date) = 2005
  GROUP BY s.staff_id;
  ```

* 6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables `film_actor` and `film`. Use inner join.

  ```sql
  SELECT f.title, COUNT(fa.actor_id) AS 'Actors'
  FROM film_actor AS fa
  INNER JOIN film as f
  ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
  GROUP BY f.title
  ORDER BY Actors desc;
  ```

* 6d. How many copies of the film `Hunchback Impossible` exist in the inventory system?

  ```sql
  SELECT title, COUNT(inventory_id) AS '# of copies'
  FROM film
  INNER JOIN inventory
  USING (film_id)
  WHERE title = 'Hunchback Impossible'
  GROUP BY title;
  ```

* 6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:

  ```sql
  SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(p.amount) AS 'Total Amount Paid'
  FROM payment AS p
  INNER JOIN customer AS c
  ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
  GROUP BY c.customer_id
  ORDER BY c.last_name;
  ```

* 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters `K` and `Q` whose language is English.

  ```sql
  SELECT title
  FROM film
  WHERE title LIKE 'K%'
  OR title LIKE 'Q%'
  AND language_id IN
  (
   SELECT language_id
   FROM language
   WHERE name = 'English'
  );
  ```

* 7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film `Alone Trip`.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM actor
  WHERE actor_id IN
  (
    SELECT actor_id
    FROM film_actor
    WHERE film_id =
    (
       SELECT film_id
       FROM film
       WHERE title = 'Alone Trip'
      )
   );
  ```

* 7c. You want to run an email marketing campaign in Canada, for which you will need the names and email addresses of all Canadian customers. Use joins to retrieve this information.

  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name, email, country
  FROM customer cus
  INNER JOIN address a
  ON (cus.address_id = a.address_id)
  INNER JOIN city cit
  ON (a.city_id = cit.city_id)
  INNER JOIN country ctr
  ON (cit.country_id = ctr.country_id)
  WHERE ctr.country = 'canada';
  ```

* 7d. Sales have been lagging among young families, and you wish to target all family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies categorized as _family_ films.

  ```sql
  SELECT title, c.name
  FROM film f
  INNER JOIN film_category fc
  ON (f.film_id = fc.film_id)
  INNER JOIN category c
  ON (c.category_id = fc.category_id)
  WHERE name = 'family';
  ```

* 7e. Display the most frequently rented movies in descending order.

  ```sql
  SELECT title, COUNT(title) as 'Rentals'
  FROM film
  INNER JOIN inventory
  ON (film.film_id = inventory.film_id)
  INNER JOIN rental
  ON (inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id)
  GROUP by title
  ORDER BY rentals desc;
  ```

* 7f. Write a query to display how much business, in dollars, each store brought in.

  ```sql
  SELECT s.store_id, SUM(amount) AS Gross
  FROM payment p
  INNER JOIN rental r
  ON (p.rental_id = r.rental_id)
  INNER JOIN inventory i
  ON (i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id)
  INNER JOIN store s
  ON (s.store_id = i.store_id)
  GROUP BY s.store_id;
  ```

* 7g. Write a query to display for each store its store ID, city, and country.

  ```sql
  SELECT store_id, city, country
  FROM store s
  INNER JOIN address a
  ON (s.address_id = a.address_id)
  INNER JOIN city cit
  ON (cit.city_id = a.city_id)
  INNER JOIN country ctr
  ON(cit.country_id = ctr.country_id);
  ```

* 7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. (**Hint**: you may need to use the following tables: category, film_category, inventory, payment, and rental.)

  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(amount) AS 'Total Sales', c.name AS 'Genre'
  FROM payment p
  INNER JOIN rental r
  ON (p.rental_id = r.rental_id)
  INNER JOIN inventory i
  ON (r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id)
  INNER JOIN film_category fc
  ON (i.film_id = fc.film_id)
  INNER JOIN category c
  ON (fc.category_id = c.category_id)
  GROUP BY c.name
  ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC;
  ```

* 8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.

  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW top_five_genres AS
  SELECT SUM(amount) AS 'Total Sales', c.name AS 'Genre'
  FROM payment p
  INNER JOIN rental r
  ON (p.rental_id = r.rental_id)
  INNER JOIN inventory i
  ON (r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id)
  INNER JOIN film_category fc
  ON (i.film_id = fc.film_id)
  INNER JOIN category c
  ON (fc.category_id = c.category_id)
  GROUP BY c.name
  ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```

* 8b. How would you display the view that you created in 8a?

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM top_five_genres;
  ```

* 8c. You find that you no longer need the view `top_five_genres`. Write a query to delete it.

  ```sql
  DROP VIEW top_five_genres;
  ```
