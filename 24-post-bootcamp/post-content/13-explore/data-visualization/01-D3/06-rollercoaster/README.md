# Rollercoastin'

As time has progressed the engineering feat of roller coasters have grown more and more impressive with some coasters reaching unprecedented heights. In this activity you will be graphing the height of various roller coasters around the world! 

## Instructions

* Using the provided starting `app.js` file, Within the `d3.csv` method callback, do the following:
    * Cast the height as numbers.
    * Create scale functions for your x and y values.
    * Create functions to generate your x and y axes.
    * Render your axes to the page.
    * Render rectangles to the page to create your bar chart.

## Challenge

* Sort the data returned from the `d3.csv` method by either:
    * tallest to shortest
    * alphabetically by name

## Hints

* Use prior class activities for reference.
* Checkout this reference material on [D3 Scales](http://d3indepth.com/scales/).
* See this example of create [D3 Band Scales & Bottom Axes](https://bl.ocks.org/biovisualize/9c0d30d0539914ecdb15). Remember that the domain and range must both be arrays.
* For assistance with axis creation with D3, see the [d3-axis documentation](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis).
