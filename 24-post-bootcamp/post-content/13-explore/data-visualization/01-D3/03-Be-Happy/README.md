# Be Happy!

In this activity, let's lift our spirit! Be happy. Smile. You're going to be creating a yellow smiley face using only svg elements and d3.

## Instructions

* Select the body using d3 and append a new svg container. Specifiy the svg container's height and width of `500px`
* Create a circle with an x and y axis value of `128` and a radius of `120` and make its color gold
* Now create two eyes with a radius of `12` and make their colors white
* Finally create the smile! Create an svg path with the given coordinate values. Make sure it has no fill and an `8px` stroke that is rounded and the same color as the eyes

When you are done there should be a happy yellow smiley face staring back at you. Don't worry! Be happy!

## Hint

* You will need to look into `svg` syntax for creating paths
