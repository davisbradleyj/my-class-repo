# News API and JSON

In this exercise you'll be using the News API to generate a JSON object.

## This includes

* Calling the API to grab data
* Testing that API data is returned correctly
* Formatting the data into a JSON object
* Printing the data in JSON format

## Dependencies

In order for you to test and make calls to the API you will need to generate your own API key and store it in a `config.py` file. An API key for this exercise can be generated at [this link](https://newsapi.org/)
